# [1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/description/)

__Easy__

Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

 

__Example 1:__

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]

Output: 8

Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

__Example 2:__

Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]

Output: 0
 

__Constraints:__

m == grid.length <br>
n == grid[i].length <br>
1 <= m, n <= 100 <br>
-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
 

Follow up: Could you find an O(n + m) solution?
