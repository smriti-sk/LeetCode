# [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
_Easy_

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 

__Example 1:__

Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

__Example 2:__

Input: x = -121 <br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

__Example 3:__

Input: x = 10 <br>
Output: false <br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

__Constraints:__

-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
